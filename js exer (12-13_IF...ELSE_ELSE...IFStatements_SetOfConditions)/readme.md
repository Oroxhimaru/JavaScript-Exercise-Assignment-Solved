# INFO

Whether you should use `parseInt` or `parseFloat` depends on your specific use case:

1. **parseInt:** This function is used to parse a string and convert it into an integer (a whole number). It truncates any decimal places and returns only the whole part. For example, `parseInt("10.99")` would return `10`.

   - Use `parseInt` when you need to work with whole numbers or integers.
   - It's commonly used when dealing with things like counting items, indices, or any situation where fractions or decimals are not relevant.

2. **parseFloat:** This function is used to parse a string and convert it into a floating-point number (a number that can have decimal places). For example, `parseFloat("10.99")` would return `10.99`.

   - Use `parseFloat` when you need to work with numbers that can have decimal places.
   - It's useful for dealing with things like prices, measurements, or any scenario where you need to be precise with fractional values.

In summary, choose `parseInt` when you want to work with whole numbers, and choose `parseFloat` when you need to work with numbers that may have decimal places. Your choice should align with the specific requirements of your program.
